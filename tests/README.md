## Manual Testing Checklist

### Cross-Browser Compatibility
- [ ] Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)
- [ ] Edge (latest)
- [ ] Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

### Functionality Tests
- [ ] Search with 1 character (should not trigger search)
- [ ] Search with 2+ characters (should trigger search)
- [ ] Search with special characters
- [ ] Search with Unicode characters
- [ ] Empty search (should hide results)
- [ ] Very long search queries
- [ ] Network disconnection during search
- [ ] Rapid typing (debouncing test)

### Keyboard Navigation
- [ ] Arrow Down (navigate down results)
- [ ] Arrow Up (navigate up results)
- [ ] Enter (select highlighted result)
- [ ] Escape (close results)
- [ ] Tab (proper focus management)

### Accessibility
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Keyboard-only navigation
- [ ] ARIA labels and roles
- [ ] Color contrast ratios
- [ ] Focus indicators

### Mobile Testing

- [ ] Input sanitization

## Expected Results

### Successful Test Criteria
- All unit tests pass
- API returns proper JSON responses
- Search results display correctly
- Keyboard navigation works smoothly
- No console errors
- Performance metrics within acceptable ranges
- Security measures prevent attacks

### Performance Benchmarks
- Search API response: < 500ms
- DOM update time: < 100ms
- Memory usage increase: < 1MB per search session
- Debounce delay: 300ms Â± 50ms

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Tests fail to initialize**: Ensure search.js is properly loaded
2. **API tests fail**: Check server configuration and database connection
3. **Performance tests inconsistent**: Run multiple times for average results
4. **Cross-browser issues**: Check console for JavaScript errors

### Debug Tips
- Open browser developer tools
- Check network tab for API requests
- Monitor console for JavaScript errors
- Verify CSS styles are loading correctly
- Test with different screen sizes

## Continuous Testing

### Automated Testing Setup
1. Set up automated browser testing with Selenium
2. Create CI/CD pipeline for backend tests
3. Monitor performance metrics in production
4. Set up error tracking and logging

### Regular Testing Schedule
- Run full test suite before each deployment
- Perform cross-browser testing weekly
- Conduct performance testing monthly
- Review and update tests quarterly
